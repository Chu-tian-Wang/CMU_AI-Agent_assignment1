all the agent will remember of it.

Write a concise, factual working memory under these headings, leaving out a \
heading only when there is nothing for it:
- Objective: the task, restated in one or two sentences.
- Constraints: rules and requirements the agent must keep following.
- Files: paths inspected or changed, with the relevant functions or line numbers.
- Commands: the commands that mattered, and what each one showed.
- Edits: every change made so far, file by file, precise enough to redo or revert.
- Concrete results: verified facts, exact error messages, values, and outputs.
- Failed approaches: what was tried and did not work, and why, so it is not repeated.
- Tests: what was run, and what passed or failed.
- Blockers: open problems and unanswered questions.
- Next action: the single most useful next step.

Merge the previous working memory and the new steps into one updated memory, \
and keep every fact from it that the new steps do not supersede. State only what \
the transcript shows. Quote short identifiers, paths, and error lines exactly, \
but never copy long raw output: summarize it. Reply with the working memory \
